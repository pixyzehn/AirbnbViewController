AirbnbViewController
====================

Airbnb version 4.7's three-dimensional slide menu in Swift. Unfortunately, the menu was obsoleted in Airbnb version 5.0. In order not to forget the legend menu, I developed it in Swift.

Inspired by https://github.com/TaPhuocHai/PHAirViewController.

Overview
## Description

Storyboard is not supported. You need to write code.
I have no choice but to use Objective-C in a part of whole.

## Demo

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
# The following is a Library of Swift.
use_frameworks!
pod 'AirbnbViewController'
```

Then, run the following command:

```ruby
pod install
```

And then, you need to have [project-name]-Bridging-Header.h because AirbnbViewController use Objective-C file.

The easiest way to create a bridging header file is to add an arbitrary Objective-C file to your project and let Xcode create the bridging header for you.
Delete the original Objective-C file as you no longer need it.

[project-name]-Bridging-Header.h

```objc
#import "AirbnbHelper.h"
```

Please refer to AirbnbViewController-Sample project.
